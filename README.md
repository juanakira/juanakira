- 👋 Hi, I’m @juanakira
- 👀 I’m interested in cars, web development, music, video editing
- 🌱 I’m building full stack projects in the MERN stack, but also with some Python (Django and Flask for backend but also for other things like data science, computer vision or AI generated images), and also in frameworks for simple static sites like Jekyll and Hugo, and Gatsby for React. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that combine some of the above interests
- 📫 You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/juan__akira)
