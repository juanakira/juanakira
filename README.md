- 👋 Hi, I’m @juanakira
- 👀 I’m interested in cars, web development, music, video editing
- 🌱 I’m currently focused on learning the Full-Stack Web Development, but also in some Python (Django and Flask for backend but also for other things like data science and computer vision), and also in frameworks for simple static sites like Jekyll and Hugo, and Gatsby for React. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that combine some of the above interests
- 📫 You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/juan__akira)
